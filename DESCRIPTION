Description: Create publication-quality, 2-dimensional visualizations of alpha-helical peptide
  sequences. Specifically, allows the user to programmatically generate
  helical wheels and wenxiang diagrams to provide a bird's eye, top-down view of
  alpha-helical oligopeptides. See Wadhwa RR, et al. (2018)
