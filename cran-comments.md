## Test environments
* local OS X install, R 3.3.3
* ubuntu 14.04 (on travis-ci), R release
* win-builder (devel and release)

## R CMD check results
There were no ERRORs or WARNINGs. There was 1 NOTE.

The NOTE concerned 5 potential misspellings. I have reviewed all 5, and they are appropriate (e.g. peptide is not recognized as a dictionary word, but is part of the vocabulary of biochemists).
