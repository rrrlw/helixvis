## Special notes

* This is a resubmission. The first review brought up the following changes:
  - change "wenxiang diagram" to "Wenxiang diagram"; however, the latter is the proper usage (wenxiang is a common noun) as seen on the Wikipedia page and the original article introducing them <doi:10.1002/(SICI)1097-0134(199705)28:1<99::AID-PROT10>3.0.CO;2-C>.
  - remove redundant mention of "helixvis" in DESCRIPTION; this change has been made and the DESCRIPTION file has been changed accordingly.
