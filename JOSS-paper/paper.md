# Summary

- First paragraph describes use of 2-dimensional visualizations of alpha-helical peptides and introduces helical wheels and wenxiang diagrams (cite @wheeldiag, @wenxiangdiag)

Studying the interactions of short peptides is conceptually non-trivial, even when the peptide's primary and secondary structures are known.
The difficulty is often a result of the spatial complexity inherent in an $\alpha$-helix, a commonly observed form of protein secondary structure.
Identification of hydrophobic faces formed by secondary structure is a common challenge that can be solved using projections of amino acids on a two-dimensional surface.

- Second paragraph gives reader high-level purpose of helixvis
- Third paragraph describes current and future applications of helixvis in scientific research and education (cite @apd, @camp, @amp-design)
