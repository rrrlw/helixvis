#' Quick and easy visualization of alpha-helical sequences.
#'
#' The helixvis package allows visualization of alpha-helical peptide
#' sequences in the form of helical wheels. Although
#' online servers currently exist that do this, all currently
#' require entering sequences and storing images individually.
#' None known to us are completely open-source. This package
#' allows users to create visualizations for entire databases of amino acid
#' sequences without need for manual input.
